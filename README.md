Hi, welcome to my beverage store / e-commerce project :D

Link to the live project, from github pages: https://tonybrandt.github.io/project-valhalla/

Inside the header, under the navigation bar, there is a button that has the function to put the page in dark mode. The default page is in light mode. The page mode is saved in the storage.

The product cards are created dynamically, through an asynchronous call with JavaScript.
